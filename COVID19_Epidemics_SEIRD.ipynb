    "# A Simple SEIRD Model for COVID-19\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a simple network-based model of COVID-19. The model is was prompted by the UK proposal to combat COVID-19 through herd immunity of the younger population, in order to protect the older and immunodepressed population.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question this model is studying is: **is herd immunity an effective strategy to minimize loss of life among at-risk individuals?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Probabilistic Finite State Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "The model considers the dynamics of $N$ individuals switching across states, as shown in the below diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![State diagram](doc/states.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The states are as follows:\n",
    "* **Susceptible** ($S$): Individuals who do not have the disease. Each day, they switch to **Exposed** if in contact with an exposed or infected individual, according to a probability that depends on the state of that individual ($p_\\text{contagion,e}$ or $p_\\text{contagion,i}$).\n",
    "* **Exposed** ($E$): Individuals who have the disease and can transmit it, but are asymptomatic. This lasts on average $t_\\text{incubation}$ days, after which they switch to **Infected**.\n",
    "* **Infected** ($I$): Individuals who are showing symptoms. This lasts on average $t_\\text{symptomatic}$ days. Subsequently, individuals switch to either **Recovered** or **Dead** depending on probability $p_\\text{recover}$ or $p_\\text{die}$ (with $p_\\text{recover} + p_\\text{die} = 1$).\n",
    "* **Recovered** ($R$): Alive individuals who are not sick nor susceptible.\n",
    "* **Dead** ($D$): Dead individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate social network effects, this model uses a static [Barabasi-Albert scale-free network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model). After the network is built, a fraction $p_\\text{die}$ of the nodes is randomly marked as the nodes who will die if infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code below, we perform 100 Monte Carlo simulations and show a graph with the average and standard deviation of the number of agents per state over time (time is discrete and corresponds to a day). No parameter fitting has been performed yet."
